//   whole in one transaction (workspaces.ts deleteDemoWorkspace);
// - change-log rows older than CHANGE_LOG_DAYS in every workspace, and a demo company's rows past its
//   newest LIMITS.logRowsPerDemoWorkspace (repo.ts pruneChangeLogs);
// - invite links that expired more than a week ago;
// - the assistant's daily counts (assistant_usage) of days more than ASSISTANT_USAGE_DAYS ago.
// Each step runs even when an earlier one failed; the first error is thrown at the end, after the rest.
