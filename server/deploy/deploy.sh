# First Twenty: update the server on EC2 to the latest code.
#
# Run it on the instance as the login that owns the code (ubuntu or ec2-user), not with sudo, in the
# folder the service runs (/opt/first-twenty). It refuses to run from any other copy of the code:
#   cd /opt/first-twenty
#   bash server/deploy/deploy.sh                               git pull, then everything below
#   bash server/deploy/deploy.sh --no-pull                     the code is already in place
#   bash server/deploy/deploy.sh --archive ~/first-twenty.tgz  unpack a code archive first (no git needed)
#   bash server/deploy/deploy.sh --skip-backup                 migrate without a fresh backup (not advised)
#
# Steps: get the code, npm ci, npm run build:all, check for pending migrations, back up the database
# when there are any (sudo systemctl start first-twenty-backup), npm run server:migrate (with the
# settings from /etc/first-twenty/env), restart the service, then check /api/health locally and through
# Caddy. If a step fails it stops there; the server keeps running the version it already loaded. When a
# migration ran and the new server is not healthy, it prints the way back, with the file name of the
# backup it took just before migrating. A backup that wrote its local dump but then failed (the copy to
# S3) does not stop the deploy: that dump is the way back, and the script warns. HEALTH_URL and
# HEALTH_WAIT_SECONDS (default 30) change the health check, for example:
#   HEALTH_WAIT_SECONDS=90 bash server/deploy/deploy.sh
#
# Rolled back with git checkout <commit>? Run git switch main (or your branch) before the next plain
# deploy: until then git pull has no branch to update, and this script stops and says so.
#
# Copying code without git, from your computer (Git Bash or PowerShell, in the project folder):
#   git archive --format=tar.gz -o first-twenty.tgz HEAD
#   scp -i your-key.pem first-twenty.tgz ubuntu@your-domain:~
#   ssh -i your-key.pem ubuntu@your-domain "cd /opt/first-twenty && bash server/deploy/deploy.sh --archive ~/first-twenty.tgz"
# (git archive packs only committed files.) With rsync on both ends you can push the folder instead:
#   rsync -az --delete --exclude node_modules --exclude .git --exclude .env --exclude .data \
#     ./ ubuntu@your-domain:/opt/first-twenty/   and then run deploy.sh --no-pull
